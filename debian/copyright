 "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE LGPL
 .
 Classpath is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
 with the following clarification and special exception.
 .
 Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
 a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
 GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
 .
 As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
 permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
 executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
 and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
 choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
 the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module
 is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify
 this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library,
 but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this
 exception statement from your version.
